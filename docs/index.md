## Introduction 

Institutions manage vast amounts of data, often reaching petabyte scales across multiple Linux-based storage servers. Users storing data in these systems need a streamlined way to modify ACLs to grant or revoke access for collaborators. Currently, the IT teams at such institutions are responsible for manually handling these ACL modifications, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially as data volume and user demands grow. To address this challenge, a Web Management Interface is built to allow users to modify ACLs securely. This system eliminates the burden on IT teams by enabling on-demand permission management while ensuring security and reliability. The system features a robust and highly configurable backend, high-speed databases, orchestration daemons for file storage servers, and an intuitive frontend.
