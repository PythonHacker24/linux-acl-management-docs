# Introduction

The backend component serves as the central component for Linux ACL Management System. It manages the creation of all the sessions, scheduling transactions, executing them in a systematic manner while serving the frontend with data and endpoints to control the system. It has access to all the mounts that need ACL management and connections to daemon where ACL changes are required to be executed (in case where ACL commands cannot be executed on the mount).
