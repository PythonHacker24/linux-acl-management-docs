# Introduction

The frontend component serves as the user facing component for Vortex. It helps users log in and interact with all the file permissions. It is highly decoupled with the backend and does not have any control over the infrastructure. All the interactions scheduled are processed by the backend. Hence, frontend is the zero-trust component in this system.
